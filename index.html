<h2>My Thoughts on Web Accessablity</h2>
<p>
  
  With how ingrained the web as became, more and more people are using it. 
  Web Accessablity, to me, is defined by how well it can accomodate to a person and the host.
   A personal example. I have ASD and I have light sensitivity. 

   'Dark mode' accomodates for me to make my experience better. 
   Host wise, I'd say it's important that the web can adapt to different platforms such as a phone or laptop, even a different script. 
  Making the web more inclusive can open a lot of opportunities for people and can help economically too.

   According to stardust-testing.com, in their words:
  <blockquote>
    <em>"Economically, ignoring the disabled community means ignoring millions of potential customers with billions in purchasing power. 
    In the United States alone, the purchasing power of assistive-technology Internet users is worth more than $350 billion."</em>
    
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Progressive Writing enhancement</h2>
  <p></p>

  <h2>Dragon Project: Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>I sent my first draft to a few of my famliy members, my mom and dad, as well as a few of my aunts. Overall I've receved similar feedback regarding it's appearnce, that it may need a little more 'pop' in their words.regarding functionality, all said they have a positve exprience. it's just needs work visually. this feedback makes me realize that 'wow, i hate css.' But it also makes me see just how much it takes to not only create a site, but to tweak it to cater to a general user base. I knew that web devlopement wasnt easy, but to actually do it really tells me just how much time and effort it takes. My dear God. </p>
